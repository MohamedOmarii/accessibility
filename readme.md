# Accessibility Morning Challenge (60 minutes)

1. Clone this repo
```
git clone git@github.com:njsfield/accessibility-challenge.git
```
2. Open index.html
3. Improve as many semantic/accessibility issues located in index.html as you can! (to help you start, I'd recommend downloading [this](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) useful plugin for Atom)
4. Use one of the many available accessibility checking tools available online to help you. See [here](https://github.com/jsms90/web-accessibility/blob/master/tools-that-can-help.md) for a list of helpful tools.
