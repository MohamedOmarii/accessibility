# Accessibility Morning Challenge (60 minutes)

1. Fork this repo first,
2. Then clone this repo to your harddrive.
3. Open index.html
4. Improve as many semantic/accessibility issues located in index.html as you can! (to help you start, I'd recommend downloading [this](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) useful plugin for Atom)
5. Use one of the many available accessibility checking tools available online to help you. See [here](https://github.com/jsms90/web-accessibility/blob/master/tools-that-can-help.md) for a list of helpful tools.
